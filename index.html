          <h6><strong>Draft proposes drastic change in the current schooling system by proposing new 5-3-3-4
              schooling
              design from the age of 3 to 18, covering 15 years of schooling.</strong></h6>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Unless and until equality in accessing education is assured, the proposed change
          would be useless as it would not bring any
          change in the current situation of educational disparities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>Formal schooling only starts after the age 5 in the current system. But the draft proposes
              formal
              schooling system from the age of 3.</strong></h6>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• This is contrary to the globally accepted norm that formal schooling should be after
          age 5. ‘Early childhood education and pre-schooling’ is only a preparative phase before actual schooling.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Integrating it with the formal schooling would not bring any positive outcome
          instead it would reverse the
          welfare role played by anganwadis in healthy development of children. The draft ignores the contribution made
          by anganwadi system in improving health and nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>National level Testing would be conducted to check children’s learning ability in the class 3,
              class 5
              and
              class 8.</strong></h6>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Examination would welcome only fears in the children that hinder their involvement
          in education. This is the reason for introducing no-detention policy followed till class 8 in the current
          system through RTE act. But assessing their ability in the smaller classes through examination and retaining
          them in the same class once they have failed will affect children psychologically and brings inferiority
          complex. This will make pool of children to stay out of schooling.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6><strong>It is discretional for a school to decide who must give merit certificate to its students. A
              school could select its certifying authority as private board or state board or central board of
              examination.</strong></h6>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• From the above 4,5,6,7 points, it is very clear that a student after class 8,
          should either select his/her major subject for his higher education or opt for vocational education and leave
          out the dream of entering higher education. This approach brings confusion to us, because the draft fails to
          understand the social structure in India, whether vulnerable sections in the lowest rung of the society is
          able to afford this change, which section in this structure will leave at the first place before entering
          higher education. Further allowing private agency to evaluate the students cannot be accepted. Tamilnadu state
          board of examination has known for bringing quality certification and no fee for tamil medium and minimum fee
          for English medium students. The draft seems to nullify such efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>For any course from B.Sc, to B.A, there would be national eligibility examination like
              NEET.</strong></h6>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• The proposals in 8,9,10 clearly show the intention to keep majority of the
          students out of higher education. New eligibility examinations to be conducted by NTA are only profitable for
          private educational institutions, to exploit the poor and ignorant families who could not afford high cost of
          coaching. There will be no level playing field where rich and poor children are made to compete for few seats
          in higher education.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• It is completely against the long fought principle of “education for all” and
          the ideals of social justice. ‘The policy of graduate education for rich students, those who can afford it and
          the vocational education for poor, rural and deprived students’ is against constitutional values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>There is no clarity over which language would be the basic one for learning and
              teaching.</strong></h6>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Mother tongue should be the teaching language; the growing importance of English
          language and its necessity in higher education requires children to have the knowledge of English. So quality
          teachers for English have to be recruited and trained in all the schools from the primary stage itself.
          Instead of bringing that, adding new confusion and making it compulsory to learn fourth language from the
          middle stage will be useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>Third language should be taught to the children from the age of 6.</strong></h6>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Isn’t a burden for a child to concentrate on three languages instead of
          concentrating on basic subjects?
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>All school students must receive vocational education in at least one vocation from class 8 to

        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>The new education policy spearheads the privatisation of education ignoring the role of
              government
              to bring “education for all”. It says whether it is school or college, it should compete in the market for
              its continuance else it faces closure.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>All universities will be ranked in the order of 1, 2, 3 or 4 and act as Higher Educational
              institutions.</strong></h6>

        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>This policy has many features that take away the rights and sphere of activities provided by
              the
              constitution to the state governments. It will make “education” completely in the hands of central
              government. Hereafter, National educational council headed by Prime minister will take all policy
              decisions in education.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>There is no reference about long lasting demand of student elections in colleges and
              universities
              for their representation and participation in the college administration for its fair functioning. This
              democratic right of students is ignored by this draft.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>15 years of schooling and pass certificate of class 12 are not enough for entering into the
              colleges.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>A student must be qualified in pan-India examination to be conducted by national testing
              agency.</strong></h6>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>One could become doctor only after clearing EXIT examination even after clearing M.B.B.S final
              exam. NEET, an entry level examination itself has proved to be dangerous as poor students could not aspire
              to become doctor. Increasing suicidal deaths among poor students is the worst reality in India. Those poor
              who have crossed the NEET struggle and entered graduation would also now lack any possibility to become
              doctor because additional burden of EXIT exam will check their entry. Both the examinations will make
              private coaching institutes to bloom and only rich could afford the training and would become doctor. This
              policy would trouble lakhs and lakhs of poor families and future of children belonging to vulnerable
              sections.</strong></h6>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6><strong>Public schools which has low enrolment and poor infrastructure should be brought together to form
              one school complex.</strong></h6>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• This is a disruptive move. This intensifies the trouble faced by rural students as
          they should travel longer distance to get access to education. This will reduce the number of schools in
          villages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6><strong>All school teachers will be required to complete 4 year integrated degree in teaching

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Instead of bringing reforms in teacher training institutes and colleges, bringing
          new complex system for becoming teacher will hinder the entry of students who have already underwent enough
          social and economic deprivation, into teaching profession. This proposal needs greater scrutiny.

To the Joint Secretary (Internal Security-I), Ministry of Human Resource Development,

I am grateful to the Ministry of Human Resource Development for making public the Draft New Education Policy, 2019, and for providing sufficient time for comments to be submitted.

The information provided in the draft National educational policy 2019 and its serious implications:

1. The draft proposes drastic change in the current schooling system by proposing new 5-3-3-4  design,  Unless and until equality in accessing education is assured, the proposed change would be useless as it would not bring any change in the current situation of educational disparities.
2. The draft proposes formal schooling system from the age of 3. 
• Integrating pre-schooling with the formal schooling would not bring any positive outcome instead it would reverse the welfare role played by anganwadis in healthy development of children. 
3. National level Testing would be conducted to check children’s learning ability in the class 3, class 5 and class 8.
But assessing their ability in the smaller classes through examination and retaining them in the same class once they have failed will affect children psychologically and brings inferiority complex. This will make pool of children to stay out of schooling.
4. Classes 9 to 12 would be considered as secondary education and board examinations will be conducted in every 8th term.
5. All school students must receive vocational education in at least one vocation from class 8 to class 12.
6. Any private board permitted by government could give examination certificate to schools for conducting examinations.
7.  A school could select its certifying authority as private board or state board or central board of examination.
• From the above 4,5,6,7 points, it is very clear that a student after class 8, should either select his/her major subject for his higher education or opt for vocational education and leave out the dream of entering higher education.  
8. 15 years of schooling and pass certificate of class 12 are not enough for entering into the colleges.
9. A student must be qualified in pan-India examination to be conducted by national testing agency.
10. For any course from B.Sc, to B.A, there would be national eligibility examination like NEET.
• The proposals in 8,9,10 clearly show the intention to keep majority of the students out of higher education. New eligibility examinations to be conducted by NTA are only profitable for private educational institutions, to exploit the poor and ignorant families who could not afford high cost of coaching. 
11. One could become doctor only after clearing EXIT examination even after clearing M.B.B.S final exam. NEET, an entry level examination itself has proved to be dangerous as poor students could not aspire to become doctor. Increasing suicidal deaths among poor students is the worst reality in India. Those poor who have crossed the NEET struggle and entered graduation would also now lack any possibility to become doctor because additional burden of EXIT exam will check their entry. Both the examinations will make private coaching institutes to bloom and only rich could afford the training and would become doctor. This policy would trouble lakhs and lakhs of poor families and future of children belonging to vulnerable sections. 
12. It will be a burden for a child to concentrate on three languages instead of concentrating on basic subjects. 
13. There is no clarity over which language would be the basic one for learning and teaching.
• Mother tongue should be the teaching language; the growing importance of English language and its necessity in higher education requires children to have the knowledge of English. So quality teachers for English have to be recruited and trained in all the schools from the primary stage itself.

14. Public schools which has low enrolment and poor infrastructure should be brought together to form one school complex.
• This is a disruptive move. This intensifies the trouble faced by rural students as they should travel longer distance to get access to education. 
15. All school teachers will be required to complete 4 year integrated degree in teaching universities, closing all teacher training colleges.
• Instead of bringing reforms in teacher training institutes and colleges, bringing new complex system for becoming teacher will hinder the entry of students who have already underwent enough social and economic deprivation, into teaching profession. This proposal needs greater scrutiny.
16. No more promotion and wage increment for teachers based on teaching experiences. There will be intermittent examinations conducted to check teaching ability and performance. Based on that, promotion and wage increment will be provided.
• This clearly unveils the nature of new education policy which does not ingest the goals, values and purposes of our constitution and content of constituent assembly debates. This policy is the policy against social equality propounded in Article 15 and Article 16.
17. University would stop conferring degrees hereafter. Colleges should develop all required capacities to confer degree itself to its students. If a college doesn’t have that capacity, it should stop functioning. 
18. The new education policy spearheads the privatisation of education ignoring the role of government.
19. All universities will be ranked in the order of 1, 2, 3 or 4 and act as Higher Educational institutions.
20. No differentiation between public and private universities. 
21. Universities can be set up by foreign universities.
22. There is no surety for Tamilnadu to continue with 69% reservation in education.
23. The continuance of educational grants and scholarships to the students based on social and educational backwardness as criteria has no passing reference in the draft. Instead, the merit or economic backwardness would be the sole criteria for scholarships.
• The proposals mentioned in 17,18,19,20,21,22,23 could not be taken light. 
• Fund allocation to government colleges and universities are very low and decreasing. So, how one could expect them to compete with private institutions, without increasing fund and infrastructure? This would lead only to closure of public institutions. 
24. The draft gives more important to Sanskrit language, ignoring the importance of growth of other Indian languages. 
25. Policy suggests lot of changes like a single body for policy making which would lead to huge centralization of education. 
26. There is no reference about student elections in colleges and universities for their representation and participation in the college administration. This democratic right of students is ignored by this draft.

The national educational policy cannot be a policy which is against the core principles of cooperative federalism, social justice, democratic principles, equality of opportunities and right to education envisaged in our constitution. We request the MHRD to withdraw this Policy and also request the  Tamilnadu government should assert its rejection to the central government, conceding to the voices of educationalists and civil society.

Thank you,

        நம் எல்லோருக்கும் கல்வி பற்றிய கருத்துகள் உண்டு. ஆனால் கல்வி கொள்கை போன்ற முக்கியத்துவம் வாய்ந்த விஷயங்களில்
        கவனம் செலுத்தாமல், நம் கருத்துகளை முன்வைக்காமல் அமைதியாக கடந்து விடுகிறோம். அந்த அமைதி நம் குழந்தைகளின்
        எதிர்காலத்தையே பாதிக்கும். கல்விக்காக தங்கள் வாழ்வையே அர்ப்பணிக்கிற பெற்றோர் புதிய கல்வி கொள்கை பற்றி படித்து
        தெரிந்துகொள்வது அவசியம். <a
